# Line Sort

[![CI](https://github.com/lafittemehdy/linesort/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lafittemehdy/linesort/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Get your lines straight. Alphabetically, of course.

## Usage

Select your lines, then hit it:
- `Ctrl+Alt+S` (or `Cmd+Alt+S` on Mac)
- Right-click → "Alphabetize Selected Lines"
- Command Palette → "Alphabetize Selected Lines"

One quick hit and your lines are perfectly organized.

## Details

Sorts in ASCII order (case-sensitive):
```
Before:          After:
zebra            !exclaim
Apple            123
banana           @mention
@mention         Apple
123              Banana
!exclaim         banana
Banana           zebra
```

Special characters, numbers, uppercase, lowercase: All your lines end up clean and organized. Pure sorting, no cutting corners.
